# zmk-config

Welcome to my [ZMK](https://zmk.dev) configurations. This is where my wireless keyboards are set up just the way I like them.

## Sofle

The Sofle is the first custom split KB I've built. I've not ordered a kit, but instead I've sourced all components myself.

## KarlKB

After building & using the Sofle for a while, I've been getting more and more comfortable with dropping more keys.
Because of that, and because the Sofle isn't designed for wireless usage, I've designed my first fully custom keyboard myself.
